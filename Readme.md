In this example we can see an application that will send a counter to anyone that can listen in one hop.
In addition, there is configured an example on how a display should work using this library. There is one error that the display function of the OLED should be done in the main loop().
In the display we will see the Id of the device, the last counter we sent, the last counter we received and the routing table of the device.
